# API

### [API Documentation](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/18841597/UVRBkkUv)

The API was developed using the  [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) runtime environment and the [express.js](https://expressjs.com/) framework.

### Installation:

```bash
npm install
```

### Usage:
Before the API can be used, the `InterTolls` DB has to be running in a MariaDÎ’ client. Run:

```bash
node index.js
```
Now the API can be called either through a browser, the Postman App or the Frontend/CLI.
